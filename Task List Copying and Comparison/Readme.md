# **Task List Copying and Comparison**
This part builds on the initial linked list implementation by introducing features such as deep copying of task lists and equality checks between lists. 
It showcases custom logic for traversing and duplicating linked structures, reinforcing understanding of object references and memory handling. The 
program also includes formatted output and validation to ensure reliable comparison and copying between task lists.
